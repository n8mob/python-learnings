Python Learnings
================

In my years as a developer, I've found it useful to explore a language on its own terms.
That is: to keep some code files around that are valid code files that let me try some things out.

Today I thought it would be a good idea to share my ["Python Learnings" repository](https://stash.endurance.com/users/ngrigg/repos/python-learnings/browse)

So, if you have any Python questions or quirks that you think it would be good to share with everyone, let me know. I'm sure I can find a place for them in [my learnings](https://stash.endurance.com/users/ngrigg/repos/python-learnings/browse).
