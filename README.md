Python Learnings
================

In my years as a developer, I've found it useful to explore a language on its own terms.
That is, to keep some code files around that are valid code files that let me:
- try some things out
- answer questions
- resolve ambiguities
- prove things to myself

I thought perhaps it would be a good idea to share my **Python Learnings** with anyone who's interested.

So, if you have any Python questions or quirks that you think it would be good to share with everyone, let me know. I'm sure I can find a place for them here.
